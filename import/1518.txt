Students are leaving the junior high school . What are they taking with them ? A lot of things for sure , but the most important thing is friends .
We asked some teachers to give us one last lesson . The lesson is proverbs(, ) about friends . Proverbs teach people about life . Older people often teach proverbs to younger people . Every culture has proverbs . They are short and easy to remember .
Mrs Minelli says , " It is important to remember this Sicilian proverb , ' Only your real friends will tell you when your face is dirty .' It means that only good friends tell you when you are making a mistake ."
Mr Tulga says , " I have a favorite proverb about friends , ' Friendship is a plant we must water .' It is German . It means that everyone needs to take care of friendship like we take care of a garden ."
Mr Tulga says , "My grandfather in Turkey told me , 'Nobody is so rich that he can throw away a friend .' It means that everyone needs friends . Be good to them ."
The good news is :there is no test for this lesson ,. The bad news is :We will miss you .
Goodbye , friends ! Don't forget us !
