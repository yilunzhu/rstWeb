2011 is a special year to all the people in Shenzhen. The 26
World Universiade will be held in the city from August 12
to 23
.
As we all know, "Start Here" is the slogan of this great event. Does anyone know that a new life of two giant pandas will start here as well?
Shenzhen is expecting the pair of pandas for the Summer Univcrsiade. The pandas, a male and a female from Wolong Panda Research Center in Sichuan Province, will be "universiade Pandas", just like "Asian Games Pandas" and "Olympic Pandas".
Shenzhen Safari Park will rebuild its panda house to welcome the pandas. The panda house has been empty since another panda, Yongba, 25, was returned to Sichuan in 2009 because it was too old.
How old are the Universiade Pandas? What are their names? What are they like? What are their living habits? We will find out the answers in June when they arrive.
