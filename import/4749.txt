A crow   is sitting in a big tree. She has a big piece of meat in her mouth, "My babies will have a nice breakfast," she thinks. An old fox is looking for his breakfast. He sees the crow and the meat, " How can I get that piece of meat? " he thinks.
"Good morning, Mrs. Crow," says the fox. " How are you? "
But the crow doesn't say a word.
"You have very nice babies, Mrs. Crow," says the fox. " How are they? May I see them? "
Still the crow doesn't say a word.
"You are very beautiful, Mrs. Crow. And you have a beautiful voice, too," says the fox. " Would you like to sing a song for me? "
Mrs. Crow thinks, "How nice Mr. Fox is! I must sing a song for him. " So she opens her mouth, at that time, Mrs. Crow drops the meat into the fox's mouth.
