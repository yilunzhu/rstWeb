America is the world's largest food exporter  . But the worst drought   in half a century is hitting corn and wheat harvests.
By twenty-fifty, the world will have to produce at least sixty percent more food to feed more and more people. China, a major food importer  , is looking to producers around the world to make sure it can get enough food in the future.
The serious drought in the United States is adding to care about world food and prices. China has invested   in food production in Australia and New Zealand. A new source   of food is Ukraine. Ukraine was known as the breadbasket of Europe because of rich corn and wheat harvests a century ago.
Galyna Kovtok is chief manager of Ukraine's largest agricultural business, ULF. She says that within a few months her company will export corn to China. That will make Ukraine the first country outside the Americas to do so. Across the Black Sea area -- in Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan -- drought this year is pushing harvests down by fifteen to twenty percent.
Traditionally, the Black Sea area is the main source of wheat for North Africa and the Middle East. But this year, Russia may have to _ exports. However, Africa and the Middle East are now having competition with China.
