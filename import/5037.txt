Whenever there's a terrible storm, there are many sad stories. Many people lost their houses, their cars and their pets. But sometimes these stories have happy endings, too.
A family in New Jersey, US, had a cat named Vivian. She was very smart. She could even draw with her wet paws  on the floor. They all loved her very much. When hurricane   Sandy hit America in October, they moved to a safer place 13km away from home. Unluckily, Vivian was missing  . All the nine family members were worried about her. They put up posters   to find her. They looked for her everywhere they thought she could stay, but they didn't find it. The family thought Vivian was gone forever.
But six months later, Vivian showed up at their house, according to  Yahoo News. They considered   her return as a _ . No one can be sure where Vivian was for all that time.
Many animals are good at finding their way home. People usually say that dogs and cats find their way home through using their sense of smell .
But that doesn't explain how Vivian found her way back. Hurricane Sandy blew away the normal smell of home. "I wish she could talk," said her owner.
